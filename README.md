[MYNT-EYE-D-SDK]: https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-D-SDK.git
[OKVIS]: https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-OKVIS-Sample.git

1. Download and install [MYNT-EYE-D-SDK][].
2. Install dependencies and build MYNT-EYE-OKVIS-Sample follow the procedure of the Original OKVIS .
3. Update camera parameters to [here](./config/config_mynteye.yaml).
4. run okvis using mynteye depth camera.

## Install MYNTEYE OKVIS_ROS
First install dependencies based on the original okvis_ros,and the follow the type:
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_okvis/src
cd ~/catkin_okvis/src
git clone -b mynteye-d https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-OKVIS-Sample.git
cd ..
catkin_make -j4
```
## Get  calibration parameters
Through the [MYNT-EYE-D-SDK][] API, you can get the camaera and IMU calibration parameters of the currently open device,follow the steps
```
cd MYNT-EYE-D-SDK
./samples/_output/bin/get_img_params
./samples/_output/bin/get_imu_params
```
After running the above type, pinhole's distortion_parameters and camera parameters is obtained , and then update to [here](./config/config_mynteye.yaml) according to following format. It should be noted that only first four parameters of coeffs need to be filled in the distortion_coefficients.
```
distortion_coefficients: [coeffs]
focal_length: [fx, fy]
principal_point: [cx, cy]
distortion_type: radialtangential
```
## Run MYNTEYE OKVIS_ROS
Run  camera mynteye_wrapper_d
```
cd MYNT-EYE-D-SDK
source wrappers/ros/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch mynteye_wrapper_d mynteye.launch
```
Run MYNT-EYE-OKVIS-Sample
open another terminal and follow the steps.
```
cd ~/catkin_okvis
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch okvis_ros mynteye.launch
```
And use rviz to display
```
cd ~/catkin_okvis/src/MYNT-EYE-OKVIS-Sample/config
rosrun rviz rviz -d rviz.rviz
```
##HEALTH WARNING: calibration

If you would like to run the software/library on your own hardware setup, be aware that good results (or results at all) may only be obtained with appropriate calibration of the

    camera intrinsics,
    camera extrinsics (poses relative to the IMU),
    knowledge about the IMU noise parameters,
    and ACCURATE TIME SYNCHRONISATION OF ALL SENSORS.

To perform a calibration yourself, we recommend the following:

    Get Kalibr by following the instructions here https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/installation . If you decide to build from source and you run ROS indigo checkout pull request 3:

      git fetch origin pull/3/head:request3
      git checkout request3

    Follow https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/multiple-camera-calibration to calibrate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. If you receive an error message that the tool was unable to make an initial guess on focal length, make sure that your recorded dataset contains frames that have the whole calibration target in view.

    Follow https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/camera-imu-calibration to get estimates for the spatial parameters of the cameras with respect to the IMU.

Also note that the quaternion standard has been adapted to match Eigen/ROS,
thus some related mathematical description in [1,2,3] will not match the

### How do I get set up? ###

This is a catkin package that wraps the pure CMake project.

You will need to install the following dependencies,

* ROS (currently supported: hydro, indigo and jade). Read the instructions in
  http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu. You will need the additional
  package pcl-ros as (assuming indigo)

        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-ros

* google-glog + gflags,

        sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev

* The following should get installed through ROS anyway:

        sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libeigen3-dev libsuitesparse-dev
        sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

* Optional: use the the package with the Skybotix VI sensor.
  Note that this requires a system install, not just as ROS package. Also note
  that Skybotix OSX support is experimental (checkout the feature/osx branch).

        git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/libvisensor.git
        cd libvisensor
        ./install_libvisensor.sh

then download and expand the archive into your catkin workspace:

    wget https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sleutene/software/okvis_ros-1.1.3.zip
    unzip okvis_ros-1.1.3.zip && rm okvis_ros-1.1.3.zip

Or, clone the repository from github into your catkin workspace:

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:ethz-asl/okvis_ros.git

or

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethz-asl/okvis_ros.git

### Building the project ###

From the catkin workspace root, type

    catkin_make

You will find a demo application in okvis_apps. It can process datasets in the
ASL/ETH format.

In order to run a minimal working example, follow the steps below:

1. Download a dataset of your choice from
   http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets.
   Assuming you downloaded MH_01_easy/.
   You will find a corresponding calibration / estimator configuration in the
   okvis/config folder.

2. Run the app as

        ./okvis_apps path/to/okvis_ros/okvis/config/config_fpga_p2_euroc.yaml path/to/MH_01_easy/

You can also run a dataset processing ros node that will publish topics that can
be visualized with rviz

    rosrun okvis_ros okvis_node_synchronous path/to/okvis_ros/okvis/config/config_fpga_p2_euroc.yaml path/to/MH_01_easy/

Use the rviz.rviz configuration in the okvis_ros/config/ directory to get the pose /
landmark display.

If you want to run the live application connecting to a sensor, use the okvis_node
application (modify the launch file launch/okvis_node.launch).

### Outputs and frames

In terms of coordinate frames and notation,

* W denotes the OKVIS World frame (z up),
* C\_i denotes the i-th camera frame,
* S denotes the IMU sensor frame,
* B denotes a (user-specified) body frame.

The output of the okvis library is the pose T\_WS as a position r\_WS and quaternion
q\_WS, followed by the velocity in World frame v\_W and gyro biases (b_g) as well as
accelerometer biases (b_a). See the example application to get an idea on how to
use the estimator and its outputs (callbacks returning states).

The okvis_node ROS application will publish a configurable state -- see just below.

### Configuration files ###

The okvis/config folder contains example configuration files. Please read the
documentation of the individual parameters in the yaml file carefully.
You have various options to trade-off accuracy and computational expense as well
as to enable online calibration. You also have various options concerning the
things that will get published -- in particular weather or not landmarks should
be published (may be important to turn off for on-bard operation). Moreover, you
can specify how the body frame is specified (T_BS) or define a custom World frame.
In other words, the final pose published will be
T\_Wc\_B = T\_Wc\_W * T\_WS * T\_BS^(-1) . You have the option to express the
velocity as well as the rotation rates in either B, S, or Wc.

### HEALTH WARNING: calibration ###

If you would like to run the software/library on your own hardware setup, be
aware that good results (or results at all) may only be obtained with
appropriate calibration of the

* camera intrinsics,
* camera extrinsics (poses relative to the IMU),
* knowledge about the IMU noise parameters,
* and ACCURATE TIME SYNCHRONISATION OF ALL SENSORS.

To perform a calibration yourself, we recommend the following:

* Get Kalibr by following the instructions here
  https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/installation . If you decide to build from
	source and you run ROS indigo checkout pull request 3:

    git fetch origin pull/3/head:request3
    git checkout request3

* Follow https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/multiple-camera-calibration to
  calibrate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. If you receive an
  error message that the tool was unable to make an initial guess on focal
  length, make sure that your recorded dataset contains frames that have the
  whole calibration target in view.

* Follow https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/camera-imu-calibration to get
  estimates for the spatial parameters of the cameras with respect to the IMU.
